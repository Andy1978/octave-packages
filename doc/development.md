# GNU Octave - Package Extensions Index

**Development guide**

## Quick info

Your package management tool can read the **entire pacakge index**
as array of Octave structs into the variable `__pkg__` using the command:
```
function __pkg__ = package_index_resolve ()
  data = urlread ("https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/package/")(6:end);
  data = strrep (data, "&gt;",  ">");
  data = strrep (data, "&lt;",  "<");
  data = strrep (data, "&amp;", "&");
  data = strrep (data, "&#39;", "'");
  eval (data);
endfunction
```
Note, the assignment to the returned variable `__pkg__` is done within `eval`.
```
>> tic; __pkg__ = package_index_resolve (); toc
Elapsed time is 0.365517 seconds.

## Detailed information for writing a package management tool

This package index is build from the perspective of a package management tool
written in the GNU Octave language.


### Read the package index

Using the routine `package_index_resolve()` as describe in the quick info above,
an array of Octave struct `__pkg__` indexed by the package names is returned.

To get the first three packages names, for example, type:
```
>> fieldnames (__pkg__)(1:3)
ans =
{
  [1,1] = arduino
  [2,1] = audio
  [3,1] = bim
}
```


### Read package details

Using `__pkg__ = package_index_resolve ();` as above,
one can obtain more detailed information about individual packages.
The following code shows all available struct fields for `pkg-example`:
```
>> fieldnames (__pkg__.("pkg-example"))
ans =
{
  [1,1] = description
  [2,1] = icon
  [3,1] = links
  [4,1] = maintainers
  [5,1] = versions
}
```
Similar, one can see all details of the latest `pkg-example` version:
```
>> __pkg__.("pkg-example").versions(1)
ans =

  scalar structure containing the fields:

    id = 1.0.0
    date = 2020-09-02
    sha256 = 6b7e4b6bef5a681cb8026af55c401cee139b088480f0da60143e02ec8880cb51
    url = https://github.com/gnu-octave/pkg-example/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz
    depends =

      scalar structure containing the fields:

        name = octave (>= 4.2.0)
```


### Compatibility with Octave's `pkg` tool

In case you want to stay compatible with
[Octave's builtin package management tool `pkg`](https://www.octave.org/doc/v6.2.0/XREFpkg.html)
you should care about the following default settings:

- `pkg prefix` (default: `~/octave`): directory new packages are installed to.
- `pkg local_list` (default: `~/.octave_packages`): file listing installed
  local packages.  The file is simply created by saving an array of structs
  using Octave's default `save` command.
  When loading the content of this file (`load ~/.octave_packages`) an entry
  looks like this:

  ```
  >> local_packages (1)
  ans =
  {
    [1,1] =

      scalar structure containing the fields:

        name = pkg-example
        version = 1.0.0
        date = 2020-09-02
        author = Kai T. Ohlhus <k.ohlhus@gmail.com>
        maintainer = Kai T. Ohlhus <k.ohlhus@gmail.com>
        title = Minimal example package to demonstrate the Octave package extensions.
        description = Minimal example package to demonstrate the Octave package  extensions.  It shows how to organize Octave, C/C++, and FORTRAN code within  a package and to properly compile it.
        depends =
        dir = /home/siko1056/.local/share/octave/6.2.0/pkg-example-1.0.0
        archprefix = /home/siko1056/.local/share/octave/6.2.0/pkg-example-1.0.0
        loaded = 0

  }
  ```

- `pkg global_list` (default:
  [`OCTAVE_HOME ()`](https://www.octave.org/doc/v6.2.0/XREFOCTAVE_005fHOME.html)
  `/share/octave/octave_packages`):
  analogous list for global packages.


## Developing the websites of package extensions index

Two important links first:

1. Development repository: <https://github.com/gnu-octave/packages/>
2. Deployment URL: <https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/>

In this section some hints for developing this index from the server site are
given.

- The whole index is a **static website** generated by
  [bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  and hosted on
  [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

- There is **no limitation** to host the generated static pages on an
  **arbitrary webserver**.

- Build the static websites with bundler/Jekyll
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/gnu-octave/packages
  cd packages
  bundle install
  bundle exec jekyll build
  ```
  and copy the content of the generated `_site` directory to the webserver of
  your choice.

- Basically, there are two layouts.
  One for the package index `_layouts/package_index.html` (used by
  `assets/index.md`) and one for the individual packages pages
  `_layouts/package.html` (used by all `.md` files in the `package` directory).

- The index read by `package_index_resolve()` is generated from `package/index.md`.

- The package index page uses the JavaScript framework
  [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for a dynamic search feature.
  If no JavaScript is available, a static HTML table is displayed.

- The individual package pages are generated by filling the layout with the
  metadata given in YAML format.
