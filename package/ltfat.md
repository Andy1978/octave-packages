  The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave toolbox
  for working with time-frequency analysis, wavelets and signal processing.
  It is intended both as an educational and a computational tool.  The toolbox
  provides a large number of linear transforms including Gabor and wavelet
  transforms along with routines for constructing windows (filter prototypes)
  and routines for manipulating coefficients.
