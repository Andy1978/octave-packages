  The STK is a (not so) Small Toolbox for Kriging.  Its primary focus is on
  the interpolation/regression technique known as kriging, which is very
  closely related to Splines and Radial Basis Functions, and can be interpreted
  as a non-parametric Bayesian method using a Gaussian Process (GP) prior.
  The STK also provides tools for the sequential and non-sequential design of
  experiments.  Even though it is, currently, mostly geared towards the Design
  and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE), the STK can be useful for other
  applications areas (such as Geostatistics, Machine Learning, Non-parametric
  Regression, etc.).
